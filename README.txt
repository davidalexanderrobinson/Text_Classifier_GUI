	README-planning1	12/25/2013: First commit of a readme file and initial code.  I'm so excited to begin the project.  This is my first github code ever.  The rest of the week will be spent refining the design of the system.  This should take until at least the first of the new year.

	The aim of this project is to build a text classifier graphical user interface in Java.  I want to take general purpose text classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVMs, etc., and make them available via a Java Swing GUI.  The text will be input into two or more text areas.  There will then be a third test area for new text to classify.  The texts will intiially be one document/URL to a line.  The system shall rely on WEKA for some of its functionality, initially. 

  	The jury is still out on how exactly the GUI will look.  I'll draw some pictures of the GUI on paper or in GIMP and upload them soon.
